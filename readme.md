# Instructions

This repository contains the notebooks for lab-6. Complete the tasks in each `.ipynb` notebook, commit your work, and push the changes to GitHub. Your instructor will pull the completed assignment after the deadline.

Once grading is complete, your instructor will push the results to `.html` files prefixed with `feedback`. You will need to pull the changes to your local copy and open this file in a browser to view (GitHub will not render html).

Labs are briefly reviewed and run through an autograder to make solutions viewable, but any point values are only for record keeping and do not necessarily reflect your grade. Scores, which are based on completion and participation, are sent separately.

Homeworks are evaluated for accuracy. For late work, you **must** fill out the **[late work form](https://forms.gle/biMFdtCPah2utSru6)** in addition to pushing your changes for the assignment to be considered as submitted. Please consult the [syllabus](https://github.com/cab938/si330_fa20/blob/master/README.md) for more details.
